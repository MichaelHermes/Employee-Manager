The user begins by making a selection from a Main Menu of actions. Depending on the selection, additional input may be required from the user. Once all necessary information is gathered, the database is queried based on the requested action. The user is presented with tabular results of any `SELECT` queries, a confirmation message for any `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` queries, and is returned to the Main Menu to make an additional selection. The user may select the 'Quit' option from the Main Menu at any time to exit the application.
